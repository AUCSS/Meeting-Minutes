#Meeting 26/09/2016 - Git/Bash introduction

The meeting held on Monday 26/09 was the first of potentially multiple git/bash presentations. 

- Presentation given by kevin with Keeyan giving assistance.

- Gave the main overarching purpose of git/bash and introduced many to the terminal and command line interfaces
	- Many didn't have git/bash installed and many hadn't used it before
	- Brief discussion over different OS installs

- Showed the basics to github
	- People used git clone to copy the remote repo to their local machines
	- Showed git status monitoring of files
	- Showed git add and git commit usage
	- Used git branch to create seperate branches for each person to use, and then pushed these using git push (and a little troubleshooting) to push up to remote repo again

- Discussed briefly about the different teams for projects for this year
	- There are teams set up on GitHub as it is assumed/hoped that any devwork will be put through the AUCSS github 
		- Makes it easier for people to drop in and out and shows historic info too
	- Go have a look at the teams and sign up!

- Meeting ended after everyone had pushed up a modified readme to github. 
	- Intention is that Wednesdays meeting will look at some more concepts, including possibly pull requests etc.
	- Brief discussion about other projects - a lot of interest in neural networks
