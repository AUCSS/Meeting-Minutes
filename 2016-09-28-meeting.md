# Meeting 28/9/16

The meeting held on Wednesday 28/09 involved two separate group activities. 

- A presentation on basic project management 
	- We broke up everyone and created groups of people interested in specific projects
		- Most people interested in more than one project but to go through the process
		- Centred on two main projects for today: The website and the Linux OS from scratch.
	- Piece of paper projects: Being able to write down exactly what you want to ‘do’ and ‘achieve’ with the project
		- A good way of breaking up a daunting task into slightly easier to digest “modules” or areas.
	- Communication: How to best discuss between teams and team members
		- Discord/Slack/Trello/
		
- A ‘repeat’/continuation of the git/bash tutorial given on Monday.
	- For those who hadn’t attended on Monday. Quite a lot of peoples.
	- Continued on to git push and pull merges (and conflict resolution; the never-ending joys of conflict resolution).
	- Kevin set up a conflict in order to show what happened, and importantly how to fix it.

- AUCS OS
	- Made initial plan and reading materials.
	- We are following the book Linux From Scratch with the ultimate goal of creating our own distribution.
	- Propose to read the first 2 chapters from LFS: http://linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/downloads/stable/ (Until 2.7. Mounting the New Partition ).

Meeting ended.
