#First meeting 21/9/16

Hello, and welcome to the first meeting of the AUCSS. These minutes form the basis for all that transpired during the meeting.

- First order of business was a proposed change of date. Wednesdays don't work for everyone, and it was suggested that Monday or an alternative day could be used instead
	- Tuesdays was generally accepted to be a nonstarter due to conflict with the 57North Hacklab
	- We could potentially split projects between days, so Monday is project 1 whilst Wednesdays is project 2, etc.
	- Proposed using a Doodle poll to solve the conflict, post on Facebook group and email 
	
- Had a representative from Robogals attending
	- An organisation that uses Raspberry Pi's in combination with Python and other tech to create robots
	- These are used in schools to encourage more females into STEM, and show the incredible possibilites of technology
	- Brand new organisation in Aberdeen, but an established group worldwide.
	- People interested should email directly to find out more

- Group photo was taken by Adam (perhaps to put up on Facebook?)

- First presentation/workshop proposed by Kevin: Git/bash
	- Good to teach collective project management/version control principles
	- Something that isn't taught as much as would have wanted in CS courses
	- Great to use for club projects (as evidenced by Github group)

- Interest in Vagrant
	- Kevin gave personal insight into own uses of Vagrant
	- Might be an idea for projects or presentations in the future, as many people expressed interest in learning it. One person using on personal laptop too.

- Brief introductions of new members
	- Brainstorm ideas of getting people interested and involved in AUCSS.
	- More numbers = more better.

- Reading group proposed 
	- Get together perhaps once a month to discuss a book or journal article
	- Not much interest openly but perhaps something to take forward
	- Shown the 'free books' table in Meston second floor

- Interest in Raspberry Pi's high
	- Very tasty, apparently.
	- Department has approx 100 Pi's sitting unused
	- Potential used in cluster computing or using one or two to create robotics (much like Robogals from before)
	- Enquire about their use

- Room availability
	- 205 sits unused for most of the evenings and even during the day often
	- Perhaps redecorate or rearrange?
	- Important to not clash with studying students but outwith that, use as much as possible
	- Make the society great again

- Meeting ended as attending Techmeetup.
